## My dwm Compilation

All the diff files for the patches I have used are available in this repo.

### Patches used

- **cfacts-vanitygaps-6.2_combo** - This patch provides a variety of tiling layouts along with the feature of gaps. It also adds the feature of increasing or decreasing the master size
- **colorbar-6.2** - Allows the status bar to have different colors
- **cyclelayouts-20180524-6.2** - Adds shortcuts to cycle through the layouts you have added
- **dynamicswallow-20210221-61bb8b2** - This is a very handy tool when you launch an application from the terminal. The terminal which right now will contain only the logs of the application can be made to swallow by the launched application.

- **moveresize-20210823-a786211** - Floating windows can be resized or moved using keyboard shortcuts

- **statuscmd-status2d-20210405-60bb3df** - This patch goes with most of the status monitors and I have used dwm blocks here. The functionality of this patch is to enable signalling to update the status monitors.

### dwmblocks

I have used Luke Smith's fork of dwmblocks which allows clickablity along with the statuscmd patch.
